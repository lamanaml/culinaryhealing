          <p> I remember back in the day, my uncle Rico used to make the best fried bologna sandwiches known to man. You know, the kind of bologna that had the red strip around it. He would fry it up in the pan to the point that it bubbled up in the middle, and he had to cut it with a knife... Put that on white bread with mustard and I was in heaven!!! Is anybody with me?! Hehehe... those were the days. I think back now and I have to ask... what the hell is bologna anyway?!?!</p></div>

        <div><p>I tell this story just to let you know where I come from. I grew up in the 70's in the south, Durham, NC... where food was food, there was no separation of healthy food and unhealthy food, good or bad. If you could eat it and it stopped you from being hungry, it was all good. On any given day we had up to 15 people in our house to feed, and money was not abundant, so off to the local Piggly Wiggly grocery store (I am not making this name up), we went to get food to feed the family. I don't have to tell you what types of foods we ended up with. But not to worry, my grandma would "put her foot" in whatever came through the door, and each meal was prepared with love and tasted delicious!! Pig feet, pork chops, fried chicken, white rice, liver and onions, chitterlings w/ hot sauce, fried fish on Fridays! Boy were we happy. Little did we know, we were setting our bodies up to fail us. How could we know? No one ever told my grandma that pork was bad, and fried foods would eventually kill us.</p></div>

       <div><p> Fast forward many many years later... I went through a Sacred Woman initiation with with Queen Afua where we were required to become vegan for 12 weeks. My mind told me that I would starve to death... but I didn't.  During that time, I learned a tremendous amount about foods and its effects on my body and I started looking at the world through very different eyes. I had gained a profound clarity about life and food's role in it.</p>
       </div>
        <div><p>I started to notice how we made no connection between the food that they ate and the dis-ease that we harbored. We had been deceived about food and sickness in a massive and scandalous way! Seeing this, I became passionate about showing people the truth about food and letting them know that we have choices, and we have to take control of our own health and wellness. We have become dependent on grocery stores which sell us food that is unfit for human consumption, doctors who are more motivated by profit than cures, and medicines which work against our bodys ability to heal itself. We must inform ourselves and make better decisions about our health and well being. And know that in doing this, we do not have to sacrifice taste.   To me, this is not only about living a healthier happier life, but it's also about getting that clarity to understand what our life's purpose is and experiencing our strong and divine connection with the Creator.</p></div>

       <div><p> Whew!  That was a mouthful... this is my journey, join me if you can...</p>

            <p>
                It began for me in the early ‘90s after seeing a news report on U.S. slaughterhouses. Once I realized how stressing animals toxifies the meat we eat, I decided to remove red meats from my diet. Five years later, I realized turkey sandwiches and chicken wings were the culprits of my constant digestive issues, I cut them out too. For 10 years I considered myself vegetarian but I staked the claim while filling up on processed vegan/vegetarian meats, processed carbohydrates, and other sugary/salty foods and beverages.</p>
            <p>
            My journey then led me into the investigation of the natural cures for certain dis-eases, and strategies for how to “eat to live.”</p>
            <p>
            Impressed by her transition to a healthier lifestyle, I joined LaMana’s first 21-Day Cleanse in 2005. I was on my way.</p>
            <p>
            Today, I’m considered pescatarian. I generally keep a clean diet of minimally processed foods and limited beverages. I read all ingredient labels, mostly “shopping the perimeter” and  buying brown. I stay vegan/vegetarian-friendly and use a variety of sustainable personal products and accessories. </p>

    <p>
    Are you feeling tired, uninspired, sick, unhealthy, stuck in a rut? Well, in this day and age we are over exposed to harmful chemicals, polluted water, hormones, preservatives, additives and heavy metals just to name a few. These substances invade our bodies faster than the body can emit them, causing toxic overload in every part of our system, producing harmful effects in our state of health.
      </p>
           <p>

Toxins become encased in mucus or fat. These deposits are then set aside in your body as a protection so that they cannot cause damage to your cells, organs and tissues. Many people carry 10-20 pounds or more of extra fat in their body that was created to house this toxic waste. It is not just excess fat but EXCESS TOXIC FAT that your body cannot cycle through because it is so extremely overloaded by more and more waste, day in and day out... so the pounds continue to pile on. If you suffer from headaches, chronic back or joint pain, sinus or respiratory problems, allergies, asthma, skin disorders, brittle hair and nails, unexplained weight gain, poor memory recall or disconnected thought patterns (feeling spaced out), chronic fatigue, insomnia, irritability, depression, uncontrollable mood swings, bad breath, body odor, a coated tongue or just feel sick and tired all over and it cannot be medically explained as to why, then you are most likely experiencing toxic overload.
  </p>
       <p>

These detox and cleansing programs are designed to slow down the amount of toxins that you are taking in so that your body can begin to eliminate the stored toxins and heal and regenerate itself! From these programs, you will lose weight, become more spiritually connected, gain mental clarity, and give your body a chance to heal itself!

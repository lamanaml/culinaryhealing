   <p class="lead"> Let's take a few days to arm ourselves with the knowledge needed to crush this cleanse. Below are the different phases of the cleanse. We explain each phase, what it means, what to eat, what not to eat, and give you a few activities to help to make sure you understand.  This First Steps section is here to help make sure we have all of the information that we need before we start on day 1.  </p>

                Learning how to read labels is one of our most powerful weapons for a healthy diet.  First, ignore the front of the package (they are lying to us), go straight to the back.  The main ingredients that we should avoid are: 
                <ul class="default">
                  <li>- Hydrogenated oils</li>
                  <li>- Partially hydrogenated oils</li>
                  <li>- Monosodium Glutamate (aka MSG).</li>
                  <li>- High fructose corn syrup</li>
                  <li>- - Artificial Sweeteners (including aspartame and sucralose - aka splenda)</li>
                  <li>- Artificial Colors</li>
                </ul>
                 Make sure the ingredients listed are real food, meaning that you can identify where it comes from.  Avoid items with 10 syllable ingredients. Check the serving size, as sometimes it is manipulated so that the nutrition looks acceptable at first glance.

                  Toxins love to stay inside of us, controlling us.  As we start do to things to purge them, they will try to  sabotage our progress.  We need to establish some tools to help us stay the course.  Journaling, prayer and meditation will allow us to combat not only the physical toxins, but the emotional ones that have been stored for years as well.  We can write our thoughts, feelings, frustrations, joys.  We can pray for strength and guidance, we can meditate on the things that we would like to manifest.  During this journey, we will have to find the peace inside of the storm.  We will have to find comfort when we are uncomfortable.  Let's identify our weapons so that we can fight fire with fire!!

                    The truth is, what we put into our bodies is half the battle.  The other half is.. what comes out.  We are reintroducing toxins back into our system at an insane rate, and if our bodies can not purge them in time, they will get reabsorbed.  Colonics and enemas are an excellent way to purge pounds of toxins quickly. If we are feeling sluggish, feeling sick, or irritable... It's time to flush the colon.  Here are a few <a href="http://www.ljaidetoxme.com/faqs.html">FAQ's about colonics</a> from my favorite therapists.  Let's talk about this in the group discussion!

                  I am personally not a fan of vitamins and supplements, due to the fact that they are isolated nutrients.  I believe that getting these nutrients from food is the most beneficial way.  If you are deficient in some vitamin, I recommend finding a food that is high in it and adding it to your daily diet.

                  This is vegan cleanse so we will not consume any animal products during our 3 week journey.  This is not to say that you can not enjoy meat and dairy as a part of a healthy diet beyond the cleanse... many people do.  Eating meat and dairy is a personal choice, and if you feel that you would like to include it beyond the cleanse, it's perfectly OK.  You just have to watch the quality and the quantity of the animal products.  Purchase responsibliy raised animals and organic dairy from reputable sources, and enjoy them more as a condiment... not the main dish.

                <p> There are two types of carbohydrates, refined and complex.</p>
                <p>Refined carbs started off as a whole food, but have been stripped of much of the fiber and nutritional content. This includes white rice, white pasta, white sugar, white bread, most commercially available cereals etc. Because the fiber has been removed it enters your bloodstream quickly, spikes your blood sugar and leaves you feeling depleted soon after.</p>

                <p>On the other hand complex carbs (which we can and should eat) are completely unprocessed whole foods and enter your bloodstream more gradually giving you sustained energy. These are whole grains like oats, brown rice, quinoa, millet, farro and starchy vegetables like potatoes.  Do not let the advertising on foods trick you. The only foods that are whole grains are actually whole grains. Bread, whole wheat bagels, cereals, etc. are NOT whole grains. They are cracked grains, processed, and as a result, are simple sugars. </p>

                    <li>Be on the lookout for raw food on the menu of ordinary restaurants</li>
                    <li>Mexican restaurants have salsa and guacamole</li>
                    <li>Japanese restaurants have miso soup (pick out the tofu), seaweed salad and veggie sushi (ask them to make it without the rice).</li>
                    <li>Most restaurants will have salads on the menu, just ask them to take off anything that is not raw.</li>
                    <li>Try natural food stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and Wild Oats as they usually have some raw items, even if it is just raw flax crackers.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li> Your body is detoxing, so you may get headaches, flu-like symptoms, nausea, irritable.. It is OK.</li>
                    <li>Your digestive system may be acting up. You may experience gas, bloating, constipation, or many bowel movements. It is OK.</li>
                    <li>You may get frustrated because your grocery bill may be a little (or a lot) higher than normal... It is OK (better to spend $$ up front on quality foods than at the end on dr. bills)</li>
                    <li>You may have skin breakouts, discharge, coated tongues, funny smells... It is OK</li>
                    <li>You may be very emotional, crying for no apparent reason, or extremely happy. The thing with this is that foods lock in all of the emotions that we are feeling while we are eating. And when the toxins in that food get locked and stored away, so do those emotions (this is why you should not eat during emotional times, you should fast through them). When you detox, those toxins are released with guess what... so are those emotions. Whatever you felt when your first love broke up with you in the 12th grade and you pigged out junk... That is going to come back out again, and you may find yourself soaking in a salt bath just crying... You are not crazy... It is OK.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
            
                  <p>All of these things are a normal part of detox. These are your signs that your body is fighting a valiant fight for you!</p>
                  <p>Generally speaking, fruits are cleansing foods which help the body detox more quickly.   Their high water content flushes your digestive tract, your kidneys and purifies the bloodstream.  If you start to have severe detox symptoms, you should cut down on the amount of fruit juice you are drinking, you need to incorporate more vegetable juices.</p>
                  <p>During this phase, you may experience more intense detox symptoms, especially for the first 3 days (headaches, stomach aches, lack of energy, irritability, highly emotional (sadness, happiness, anger, frustration...), flu-like symptoms, acne, discharge, body odor...). Fortunately, these 3 days are over the weekend, so, if needed,  you can treat this detox like a snow day... stay in bed, get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids.  </p>
                  <p>In a few days, you should be over the majority of the symptoms, and you will start to experience a resurgence of energy.</p>

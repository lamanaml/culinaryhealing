We explain each phase, what it means, what to eat, what not to eat, and give you a few activities to help to make sure you understand.  This First Steps section is here to help make sure we have all of the information that we need before we start on day 1.  Let's have fun with the learning and activities, as the more time we spend here, the more prepared we will be for our journey! </p>

                    <div class="card-body"> Learning how to read labels is one of our most powerful weapons for a healthy diet.  First, ignore the front of the package (they are lying to us), go straight to the back.  The main ingredients that we should avoid are: 
                    <ul class="default">
                      <li>- Hydrogenated oils</li>
                      <li>- Partially hydrogenated oils</li>
                      <li>- Monosodium Glutamate (aka MSG).</li>
                      <li>- High fructose corn syrup</li>
                      <li>- Artificial Sweeteners (including aspartame and sucralose - aka Splenda)</li>

                    </ul>
                    Make sure the ingredients listed are real food, meaning that you can identify where it comes from.  Avoid ingredients with 10-syllables. Check the serving size, as sometimes it is manipulated so that the nutrition looks acceptable at first glance.

                      The toxins inside of us have a way of controlling us.  As we start do to things to purge them, they will try to  sabotage our progress.  We need to establish some tools to help us stay the course.  Journaling, prayer and meditation will allow us to combat not only the physical toxins, but the emotional ones that have been stored for years as well.  We can write our thoughts, feelings, frustrations, joys.  We can pray for strength and guidance, we can meditate on the things that we would like to manifest.  During this journey, we will have to find the peace inside of the storm.  We will have to find comfort when we are uncomfortable.  Let's identify our weapons so that we can fight fire with fire!!

                        The truth is, what we put into our bodies is only half the battle.  The other half is... what comes out.  We are reintroducing toxins back into our system at an insane rate, and if our bodies cannot purge them quickly enough, they will get reabsorbed.  Colonics and enemas are an excellent way to purge pounds of toxins quickly. If we are feeling sluggish, feeling sick, or irritable... it's time to flush the colon.  Here are a few <a href="http://www.ljaidetoxme.com/faqs.html">FAQs about colonics</a> from my favorite therapists.  Let's talk about this in the group discussion!

                      Most vitamins and supplements are isolated nutrients, meaning they are processed and not whole.  The best way to get our nutrients is from real food.  That said, some vitamins and supplements are better than others.  If you prefer to take supplements, make sure they are from a whole food source.

Spices, herbs and superfoods are welcomed additions to the cleanse as they work with our bodies to cleanse and nourish. Make sure that when tou purchase spices, especially spice blends, they do not contain preservatives or msg.

                      Keep vigirous exercise to a minimum.  Our bodies are in repair mode, which means that most of our energy should be dedicated to detoxing.   Instead, do activities that help purge... stretching, yoga, walking, and activities such as the sauna, steam room and massage.

                      <p>Refined carbs started off as a whole food, but have been stripped of much of the fiber and nutritional content. This includes white rice, white pasta, white sugar, white bread, most commercially available cereals etc. Because the fiber has been removed it enters your bloodstream quickly, spikes your blood sugar and leaves you feeling depleted soon after.</p>

                      <p>On the other hand complex carbs (which we can and should eat) are completely unprocessed whole foods and enter your bloodstream more gradually giving you sustained energy. These are whole grains like oats, brown rice, quinoa, millet, farro and starchy vegetables like potatoes.  Do not let the advertising on foods trick you. The only foods that are whole grains are actually whole grains. Bread, whole wheat bagels, cereals, etc. are NOT whole grains, they are processed grains, processed, and as a result, are simple sugars. </p>

The thing with this is that foods lock in all of the emotions that we are feeling while we are eating. And when the toxins in that food get locked and stored away, so do those emotions (this is why you should not eat during emotional times, you should fast through them). When we detox, those toxins are released with guess what... so are those emotions. Whatever we felt when our first love broke up with you in the 12th grade and we pigged out junk... That is going to come back out again, and we may find ourselves soaking in a salt bath just crying... We are not crazy... It is OK.

                      <p>All of these things are a normal part of detox. These are signs that our body is fighting a valiant fight for us!</p>
                      <p>Generally speaking, fruits are cleansing foods which help the body detox more quickly.   Their high water content flushes your digestive tract, our kidneys and purifies the bloodstream.  If we start to have severe detox symptoms, we should cut down on the amount of fruit juice we are drinking and incorporate more vegetable juices.</p>
                      <p>During this phase, we may experience more intense detox symptoms, especially for the first 3 days (headaches, stomach aches, lack of energy, irritability, highly emotional (sadness, happiness, anger, frustration...), flu-like symptoms, acne, discharge, body odor...). Fortunately, these 3 days are over the weekend, so, if needed,  we can treat this detox like a snow day... stay in bed, get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids.  </p>
                      <p>In a few days, you should be over the majority of the symptoms, and we will start to experience a resurgence of energy.</p>

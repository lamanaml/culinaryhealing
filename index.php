                  I grew up in the south, Durham, NC... where food was food, there was no separation of healthy food and unhealthy food, good and bad. If you could eat it and it stopped you from being hungry, it was all good. On any given day we had up to 15 people in our house to feed, and money was not abundant, so off to the local Piggly Wiggly grocery store (I am not making this name up), we went to get food to feed the family. I don't have to tell you what types of items we ended up with. But not to worry, my grandma would "put her foot" in whatever came through the door, and each meal was prepared with love and tasted delicious!! Pig feet, pork chops, fried chicken, white rice, liver and onions, chitterlings w/ hot sauce, fried fish on Fridays! Boy were we happy. Little did we know, we were setting our bodies up to fail us. How could we know? No one ever told my grandma that pork was bad, and fried foods would eventually kill us.
                    Fast forward many years later, I studied under Queen Afua -  and as a result, cut out all meat, dairy, fast food and processed food. During that time, I learned a tremendous amount about foods and its effects on my body and I started looking at the world through very different eyes. I had gained a profound clarity about life and food's role in it. I felt better... Much better. rmed with a new found sense of purpose I wanted to know more and studied under Gabriel Cousins at the Tree of Life in Patagonia Arizona, from there, studied at the Natural Gourmet Institue for Health and Culinary Arts</p>

          Live / raw foods are whole foods that still have the vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and enzymes intact. Why Enzymes?

Enzymes are the life force that conducts and directs every activity in your body.

Enzymes "digest" or break down food in our digestive systems.

Eating an enzyme-rich diet is thought to increase vitality, slow the aging process, help repair our DNA and RNA, break down proteins, increase weight loss and eliminate toxins.

Enzymes are heat sensitive and destroyed at temperatures above 118 degrees. This is important because the purpose of eating is to provide our bodies with these nutrients and enzymes, and if they are destroyed through cooking, we are not giving our bodies what it needs... which defeats the point... right?

 

So, during this phase, we will turn off the stoves and flood ourselves with nutrients and enzymes.

 

A couple of things to remember

Although it's best to eat at home as much as possible, there are tons of places that have raw food!

Try to find a raw food restaurant in your area.

be on the lookout for raw food on the menu of ordinary restaurants

Mexican restaurants have salsa and guacamole

Japanese restaurants have miso soup (pick out the tofu), seaweed salad and veggie sushi (ask them to make it without the rice).

Most restaurants will have salads on the menu, just ask them to take off anything that is not raw.

try natural food stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joes, and Wild Oats as they usually have some raw items, even if it is just raw flax crackers.

No food up to 2 hours before bedtime. If you get hungry, drink water or herbal tea. Hunger is sometimes a sign of thirst.

Your body is detoxing, so you may get headaches, flu-like symptoms, nausea, irritable.. It is OK.

Your digestive system may be acting up. You may experience gas, bloating, constipation, or many bowel movements. It is OK.

You may get frustrated because your grocery bill may be a little (or a lot) higher than normal... It is OK (better to spend $$ up front on quality foods than at the end on dr. bills)

You may have skin breakouts, discharge, coated tongues, funny smells... It is OK

You may be very emotional, crying for no apparent reason, or extremely happy. The thing with this is that foods lock in all of the emotions that we are feeling while we are eating. And when the toxins in that food get locked and stored away, so do those emotions (this is why you should not eat during emotional times, you should fast through them). When you detox, those toxins are released with guess what... so are those emotions. Whatever you felt when your first love broke up with you in the 12th grade and you pigged out junk... That is going to come back out again, and you may find yourself soaking in a salt bath just crying... You are not crazy... It is OK.

 

All of these things are a normal part of detox. These are your signs that your body is fighting a valiant fight for you!

 

What can we eat

In general, our diets should consist of at least 50% live foods. Eating live can mean something as simple as eating an apple or a salad, or can be so sophisticated that you will forget that it is raw! Most of the recipes that are listed in our forum are very simple, requiring basic equipment (knives, blenders or food processors) but if you have other equipment like dehydrators, mandolins or masticating juicers, I hope you will find the courage to find recipes that use them.

For those of you who are not that familiar with live foods, you may be surprised with how much you enjoy them.

 

Our primary meals will consist of:

fermented foods, seeds, and sprouts

fruits

veggies

fresh fruit juices

fruit smoothies

Try fruits and veggies that you have never tried before. By days 6 and 7 we lighten up our menu a little more to get our bodies ready for the juice phase.

<!-- 
        The next phase of the cleanse, the break fast, which consist of all live foods, is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of the cleanse. This is where the most damage can happen. We will all be really excited to eat again, and the food will taste amazing (remember Eddie Murphy and the saltine cracker that he swore was a Ritz... that is how you will be on Friday - lol!).  But we must slowly and gradually introduce solid foods back into our bodies.  After not eating for 7 days, our digestive systems are resting, so if we start pigging out immediately, we will be in worse condition than when we started.  Start with foods that are juicy and easy to digest. Save foods like bananas, collards, kale, carrots and foods that are more difficult to digest to the last couple of days of the cleanse.

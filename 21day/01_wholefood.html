          This initial phase of the cleanse is to help get everyone on the same page. We all have different dietary backgrounds (vegetarian, carnivore, vegan, SAD, pescatarian, raw... ), so this is our opportunity to sync our meals so that we can move forward as a group.

 

Whole foods are foods that are as close to nature as they can be. Think produce aisle, bean aisle, whole grain aisle. These foods have not been processed or have been minimally altered.  Whole foods can be cooked

 

When we eat food that has been processed our bodies are not sure how to handle it. Much of the fiber and nutritional value have been removed. When our bodies do not know how to process something, it treats it like a toxin, which sometimes gets stored to be dealt with later. Let's say it together "NO MORE PROCESSED FOOD!"

 

Note: Cooked food is allowed for the first two days. You can also go ahead and eat raw (uncooked) these first two days.

 

Foods to Eliminate

Starting Friday (Day 1), eliminate 

meat, fish, poultry, eggs, tofu, tempeh, and other mock meats

nuts

eggs and dairy

fast food

all processed foods - bread, pasta, white rice, white sugar, table salt, canned foods

artificial ingredients, hydrogenated oils, MSG

Coffee, caffeine alcohol and soda

drugs

 

What can we eat?

So, now that we know what we can't eat, what's left? Note that we have upgraded this list to include more alkaline ingredients. These ingredients are better choices than most:

​

Fresh veggies:

for example, green leafy vegetables, root vegetables, Squashes, Peppers, Okra, Onions and ginger, Sea Vegetables, Mushrooms...

Sea Vegetables​

Nori, Kombu, Dulse, Sea Palm, Sea Moss, Hijiki, Wakame, Arame,

Fresh fruits (no seedless fruits):

Avocado, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Limes, Bananas (try to find burro bananas), Green Bananas (use like potatoes), all Berries, Coconuts, Mangoes, Papaya, Cherries, Peaches, Melons, Figs...

Whole grains:

Brown rice, Farro, Buckwheat, Wild Rice, Quinoa, Millet, Spelt, Kamut, Teff, Amaranth, Rye

Dried fruits and Sundried Tomatoes

Seeds: 

sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds

Beans:

chickpeas, lentils, black beans, peas, red beans, kidney beans... any bean

Oils:

Grapeseed Oil, Avocado Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Coconut Oil (unrefined has a coconut taste, refined has a neutral taste - both are OK)

Salts and salty stuff

Sea salt, Himalayan crystal salt, Celtic salt, liquid aminos, tamari, shoyu

Sweeteners:

Raw honey, Maple syrup, Dates, Dried fruit, Agave nectar, and Stevia

Herbal Teas (dandelion and milk thistle are my favorites)

Any fresh herbs or dried spices

 

A note about carbohydrates

There are two types of carbohydrates, refined and complex.

 

Refined carbs started off as a whole food, but have been stripped of much of the fiber and nutritional content. This includes white rice, white pasta, white sugar, white bread, most commercially available cereals etc. Because the fiber has been removed it enters your bloodstream quickly, spikes your blood sugar and leaves you feeling depleted soon after.

On the other hand complex carbs (which we can and should eat) are complete unprocessed whole foods and enter your bloodstream more gradually giving you sustained energy. These are whole grains like oats, brown rice, quinoa, millet, farro and starchy vegetables like potatoes.  Do not let the advertising on foods trick you. The only foods that are whole grains are actually whole grains. Bread, whole wheat bagels, cereals, etc. are NOT whole grains. They are cracked grains, processed, and as a result, are simple sugars.

​We are on the final stretch of the cleanse! 
<!-- 

Today and tomorrow, we are doing whole foods again. This means you can begin eating cooked foods, and add whole grains and beans. Still, no meat, no processed foods, no white rice, flour, table salt.... You know where I am going with this. For example, a good meal for today would be bbq Portobello mushrooms, w/ sautéed cabbage and leeks, and brown rice. I am getting hungry just thinking about it! 

Many of us have lost weight, healed your bodies, enjoyed lots of energy and much more. Now the question is how do you maintain our newfound vitality... Here are a few points to keep you on the right track! Here are 10 tips to maintain a healthy lifestyle: 

1. EAT A WIDE VARIETY OF WHOLE, NATURAL FOODS

 

Eat foods in their most natural state possible-- fresh, raw, unrefined, unprocessed, and whole.

When food is cooked, preserve as much of the nutrition as possible by steaming, blanching, or baking; void boiling, microwaving, or deep frying.

Vary your meals every day--this gives you a variety of nutrients and keeps your diet fun and interesting.

Choose organically-grown foods whenever possible--they contain more minerals & nutrients and also are more tasty than non-organically grown food, which often contains pesticides known to cause cancer and other diseases. 

 

2. MAKE VEGETABLES AND WHOLE GRAINS THE CENTERPIECES OF EACH MEAL

Plan your meals around fresh vegetables and whole grains rather than meat or dairy products.

Vegetables provide essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants, which help prevent cancer.

Whole grains such as brown rice, millet, oats, barley, and quinoa regulate your appetite and improve digestion and elimination.

Seeds, beans, fish, fruit, nuts, and sea vegetables round out a balanced, whole foods diet.

Limit your consumption of boxed and canned food, refined sugars, fruit juice, white flour, meats, and dairy products, which are mucus-forming and frequently allergenic.

Totally avoid artificial sweeteners (contain aspartame or saccharin), hydrogenated oils (e.g. margarine), soda pop, and artificial ingredients--all of them are foreign to your body and contribute to disease.

Meet your nutritional needs primarily from whole foods; use nutritional supplements as complementary factors. 

 

3. DRINK 8 GLASSES OF WATER EACH DAY

Drink plenty of water each day--for most people this is 6-8 eight-oz. glasses, more during hot weather or exercise.

The more raw fruits and vegetables you eat, the less water you need to drink.

When thirsty, drink plain, room temperature water--not soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, fruit juice or milk.

Avoid drinking water and other beverages during meals--they water down and stagnate the digestive process. Avoid all beverages at least 30 minutes before and 2 hours after a meal.

Whenever possible, use reverse osmosis or filtered water that has had heavy metals and agricultural chemicals, but not the trace minerals, removed. Most commercial tap water contains unhealthy levels of chlorine and fluoride. 

 

4. EAT REGULAR MEALS AT THE SAME TIME EACH DAY*

Sit down to regular meals everyday. Sitting makes you conscious about what you eat and how much you eat. Your digestive system relaxes and is able to digest foods and absorb nutrients better.

Consistent eating patterns help you feel, think, and sleep better.

Food should be thoroughly chewed--until it turns into liquid in your mouth--before swallowing.

Skipping meals can lead to out-of-control hunger, which often results in overeating or bingeing.

It’s OK to eat 4-5 smaller meals each day--it can help you maintain a consistent energy level throughout the day. 

 

5. GO TO BED HUNGRY

Stop eating three hours before bedtime. Eating late at night leads to weight gain, poor sleep, and disturbing dreams.

Your body cleans and repairs itself while you sleep. These processes work best when your digestive system is empty.

Eat only within a 12 hour period each day--if your last food is eaten at 8 p.m., do not eat again until 8 a.m. the next day.

Going to sleep with an empty digestive system allows you to sleep more deeply and for a shorter time

After eating do not eat again until your meal has digested--usually 2-4 hours, depending on what you ate.

 

6. AVOID FOODS THAT YOU CONSTANTLY CRAVE

Avoid any food that gives you a lift or that you frequently crave, because you may be addicted to it--common examples are foods that contain caffeine, white or wheat flour, or refined sugar (a.k.a. corn syrup, brown sugar, cane juice)

If you continue to eat foods you are addicted to, over time your body will develop an allergy to it and your immune system will become weakened.

Check in with yourself to see if there are any underlying issues to your food cravings--for example, we may crave sugary foods if we feel lonely or sad, or caffeine when we are fatigued.

If you are craving a /whole food/ (a food in its natural state), eat first and ask questions later. In other words, you are probably tuned into your body’s need for nutrients the food contains.

What we crave in food is often a picture of what we crave in our life. Rather than addressing an imbalance with food, address the problem at its own level and the cravings will often disappear. 

 

7. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY’S NEEDS AND EAT ACCORDINGLY

Learn to "listen to your body"--it is constantly sending you messages about which foods you need and in what quantity.

Food IS medicine--our diet has a more powerful long-term affect on our body than any drug, herb or supplement.

There is no "cookie cutter" approach to nutrition--every one of us has different nutritional needs based on factors such as body type, age, condition, gender, ancestry, race, geographic climate, and season.

Study a variety of nutritional philosophies, but then experiment to discover what diet works best for YOU based on your unique needs. Usually our optimal diet is uncovered through a combination of intellect, intuition, and experimentation. 

 

8. EXERCISE REGULARLY

At a minimum, take a 30-minute walk every day. Walking is an excellent form of exercise for everyone. It improves flexibility, digestion, energy, and cardiovascular health, strengthens bones 
and helps clear your mind.

Regular exercise is important to maintaining a healthy weight.

Before exercising, rest for at least 30 minutes after meals to allow food to digest and assimilate easily.

Breathe deeply every day. 

 

9. UNDERSTAND THAT WELL-ROUNDED HEALTH INVOLVES MORE THAN HEALTHY FOOD

In addition to proper diet, optimal health and energy also involves adequate rest, meaningful work, emotional health, minimal stress, healthy relationships, and spiritual practice.

You cannot take any drug, herb, or supplement and expect it to overcome poor diet choices and lifestyle habits.

Examples of helpful practices include keeping a journal, yoga, meditation, martial arts, massage therapy, support groups, spiritual study/sharing groups, and maintaining a positive attitude. 

 

10. IDENTIFY YOUR PERSONAL PASSION AND GO FOR IT!

Most people don’t achieve optimal health and energy with the goal of "being healthy." We need to have a personal passion--a dream--that inspires us.

Rather than dwelling on your shortcomings, concentrate on "doing your dream" and the rest will fall into place.

Optimal health and energy is a side effect that happens to us when we are doing our "life’s work." When we are engaged in work that we truly love, there’s no place for sickness.

If you are on the path of healing from a disease, focus on what you’re going to do when you’re healthy--where you will direct the extra energy you will have once you have healed yourself. -->

<!-- I want to commend you all on a job well done!  Collectively we have lost weight, gained clarity, healed old aches and pains, broken addictions, and displayed a tremendous amount of willpower!  

​
Tomorrow, don't overdo it. Remember, you body is squeaky clean now, and it will reject toxins, the same way your toxic body rejected healthy foods 21 days ago.  Use your own discretion, but I recommend that you avoid pork, shell fish fried food and fast food restaurants, for at least another week (if you normally eat these things... Hopefully you will stay away forever). Continue to drink lots of water.  If you have a juicer, continue to drink fresh juices.  I encourage you all to keep the whole foods diet, and try to incorporate many more raw fruits and veggies in your diet each day. Also if you are not planning to eliminate meat and dairy, at least reduce the amount that you eat to once or twice a week.  And purchase only high quality organic meat and dairy.  


OK, that's it for my soap box :-)
 
Thanks for your participation, your questions and your support. -->

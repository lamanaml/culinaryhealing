  Well actually, this next phase is a juice feast! It consists of all the fresh fruit and vegetable juices, herbal teas and water you want! Water alone may leave you feeling drained, while vegetable juice will give you an energy surge.

 

Why Juice?

The nutrients in the juice you drink is absorbed immediately by all the cells in your body. Your juicer magically transfers the produce into pre-digested food. This means that your body is able to make maximum use of all the enzymes, vitamins and minerals.

Juices help you to maintain the proper PH in your body, which is important in preventing diseases like cancer.

The phytochemicals in the juice also help to remove carcinogens from your body.

 

The thing with a liquid cleanse is that your digestive system slows down enough to start to reintroduce the stored toxins back into your bloodstream so they can be eliminated. As it slows down, your hunger begins to decrease. When you introduce fiber (from foods and yes, even smoothies) it will keep your digestive system running. When this happens, you will continue to experience hunger. So the key to the juicing phase is to drink only liquid, and not to take in any fiber. As a matter of fact, if you keep it to strictly juice with no cheating, your hunger pains should subside along with your detox symptoms.  Within 3 days, you should experience little to no hunger because you have slowed down your digestive system (although you may still want to eat out of habit).  This is an important point, because you may think that by drinking a small smoothie or eating 1 or two grapes, it will help with your hunger, but it will actually prolong your hunger.

Another important thing to remember is to keep juice with you. If you don't drink enough juice, you will not have enough energy. If you are going to be out during the day, prepare enough juice to last you.  Identify all the juice bars (make sure they sell fresh juice) within a short walk or driving distance of your job, school, and house, that you can quickly get to if you need to.

What to eliminate

This week do not consume any foods, live or cooked.

Eliminate oils. Unprocessed natural oils are wonderful and have many healing properties on their own. The reason is that many toxins are fat-soluble, which means that the toxins can hitch a ride inside of the oils and get reabsorbed back into our bodies ... we don't want that.

No bottled, canned or carton juices.

No bananas or smoothies during the 7 day liquid part.

What liquids can I have this week?

Daily pre-breakfast drink: Water with the juice of 1/4 - 1/2 lemon

Fresh pressed fruit juice

Fresh pressed vegetable juice - (Juicing leafy greens becomes much easier if you roll the leaves into a little ball, before feeding it into the machine.)

Water

Herbal teas (fruity, minty, rooibos, bitters, health blends...), just make sure the ingredients don't have anything suspect, no caffeine

Vegetable broth (gently boil veggies, including onions and garlic, for 30 minutes, then strain, or purchase organic veggie broth)

Miso soup broth (fresh, powdered or from a Japanese restaurant -without the sea veggies, scallions and tofu)

Chlorophyll (it comes in liquid or capsules, either kind is fine)

Spirulina can also be used during this cleanse. It is loaded with protein and all the vitamins and minerals the body needs.

Wheatgrass or other grasses like barley grass

Kombucha (a fermented pro-biotic drink)

Coconut water (See how to open one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJjQ-mCtpSQ

Store bought juices available: BluePrint juices, Suja

 

Cleaning your fruits and veggies
Fill your sink with cold water, add 4 tablespoons of salt and the juice of a lemon.  Soak the fruits and veggies for 10 minutes then rinse under cold water.  1/4 cup of vinegar can be substituted for lemon. 
 
How to store your juice?
We drink fresh fruit and veggie juice because it still has all its nutrients and enzymes.  This means that the juice still has it's "life force".  This life force is what will give you energy throughout the cleanse.  Fresh juice begins to lose its nutrients immediately, therefore it's best to drink fresh juice right away. That said, we don't want to be in the kitchen all day juicing, so here are some tips for storing juices to keep as much of the life force intact as possible. 

Try to avoid contact with light, heat, and air as they will cause juice to oxidize (losing its life force)

Keep the juice as cold as possible.  If you have to store the juice for a while, make sure that the container is airtight and refrigerated. 

Fill the juice all the way to the top to help reduce the amount of air that gets in.

 

Tips 

Strain your juices to make sure there is no pulp. This will help eliminate hunger more quickly.

Generally speaking, fruits are cleansing foods which help the body detox more quickly.   Their high water content flushes your digestive tract, your kidneys and purifies the bloodstream.  If you start to have severe detox symptoms, you should cut down on the amount of fruit juice you are drinking, you need to incorporate more vegetable juices.

Having energy: To make sure that we have enough energy during the juice week, we should all make sure that we drink PLENTY of vegetable juices. Matter of fact, we should drink MOSTLY veggie juice and reduce the number of fruit juices that we have to maybe once a day. You can add a little beet or carrots or apples or lemons/limes to veggie juice if it helps you with the taste. But the veggie juices will help curb your appetite, give you more energy, not have as much effect on your blood sugar, and help heal and nourish you. So by day 11, let's make a pledge to do mostly veggie juice!

You can dilute your juices 1 to 1, especially fruit juices since they tend to cause more of a detox reaction. Diluting the juice will reduce the reaction, as well as dilute some of the sugars.

No juicing 2 hours before bedtime. The reason is that juice spikes your blood sugar causing your metabolic system to react. You want to give your metabolic system a rest so that it can also do some much-needed repair. If you need something within this time, drink water or herbal tea with no sweetener.

Get rid of all snacks so that you will not be tempted to nibble. Out of sight, out of mind.

 

Things to remember

Why are you doing this anyway?  Yes, juice cleansing helps you lose weight, heals all kinds of physical and mental sicknesses, removes spiritual blockages, and more.  In addition to those things, I would like for you to write down your personal reasons for participating in this cleanse, make some copies, put them on your fridge, in your car, in your office...anywhere you think you will need a reminder.  This will serve as your motivation to get you through the 7 days.

Get plenty of rest, go to sleep early

Sit out in the sunshine for as long as you can

No sexual activity during these 7 days (like how I slipped this one in on you!)

Eliminate or greatly reduce TV and radio (especially news)

Do not participate in negative, stressful and/or draining conversations (you may need to tell some of your friends and family that you will call them in a couple of weeks - lol!)

Avoid extreme temperatures for your drinks, no extremely hot or cold drinks. It will shock your resting digestive system.

You may be a little cranky this week, so just tell folks not to take it personally... you will be back to normal in a few days

Keep exercise to a minimum - listen to your body. Don't try to push yourself during this phase of the cleanse. Your body is in rest and repair mode, so you want your energy to be dedicated to that.

During this phase, you may experience more intense detox symptoms, especially for the first 3 days (headaches, stomach aches, lack of energy, irritability, highly emotional (sadness, happiness, anger, frustration...), flu-like symptoms, acne, discharge, body odor...). Fortunately, these 3 days are over the weekend, so, if needed,  you can treat this detox like a snow day... stay in bed, get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids.  

In a few days, you should be over the majority of the symptoms, and you will start to experience a resurgence of energy.


<!-- 
Congratulations! We have made it through the most difficult part of the cleanse!  Let's wake up this morning and celebrate with a glass of fresh orange juice!!  We have eliminated the largest majority of our toxins, and now our body is in straight healing mode.  For the duration of this cleanse, we should experience greater health, greater clarity and more energy.  

Now, that the physical part is taken care of, let's create the life that we want.  Begin to visualize yourself being successful through the duration of this cleanse.   Visualize yourself accomplishing the things that you want to accomplish. Visualize your body healing itself...from diabetes, from cancer, from fibroids, from barren wombs, poor digestion, addiction to foods, bad relationships...  Visualize your graduation from school.  Visualize yourself in the type of career that you want.  Visualize yourself receiving the type of cash flow that you want.  Visualize the relationship you want to have with your children.  Visualize the relationship you want to have with the creator.  Visualize yourself in your ideal relationship with your ideal mate.  Visualize yourself at your ideal weight.  Visualize yourself as a strong beautiful person who creates the life you want.  You can meditate through this, you can describe it in your journal, you can talk about it in prayer, you can scribble it on a napkin.  Just put it out into the universe and watch it manifest!  
 
"We are not human beings on a spiritual journal, we are spiritual beings on a human journey". I don't know whose quote this is, but it is profound.  Meditate on it for a while.  Don't limit yourself to what you think is possible as a human being.  Open your mind to experience life as a spiritual being.  There are no limitations.
 

What to drink

Any type of juice you want - Celebrate!
